I have build this api using nodeJs, expressJs. This api takes date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format and time in "HH:MM" format(24Hrs), and evaluating these information it's response in JSON value.

It gives if the doctor will be available on the given date & time. if doc will not available on given date & time then it gives the next earliest slot available with the date and time.
